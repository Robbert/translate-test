# Google Translate test

We were curious to find out how many people visit a website and use an automated service to translate the Dutch content to another language. It would be good to know when a significant amount of people would browse the website using for example right-to-left text directionality, or with in a script that isn't readable when using `letter-spacing`, `font-style: italic` or `font-weight: bold`. These statistics can help priotitise layout improvements for target languages we don't even provide translations for ourselves.

This repository contains some example code to track translation events using Google Tag Manager as well as [Matomo](https://matomo.org).

Another thing we wanted to investigate is if we can provide a right-to-left layout for translated versions of our website.

Examples:

- [Dutch original](https://robbert.github.io/translate-test/)
- [Arabic translation](https://robbert-github-io.translate.goog/translate-test/?_x_tr_sl=nl&_x_tr_tl=ar)
- [English translation](https://robbert-github-io.translate.goog/translate-test/?_x_tr_sl=nl&_x_tr_tl=en)
